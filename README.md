This is a website that will allow you to create buttons and search for GIFs of whatever memes you want.  It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and AJAX.

### How to use it
Simply click the link to access the website.  You can enter new search terms into the box and it will create a button for you to click.  Once you click a button containing a search term, you will see the results of the GIFs that match that term from GIPHY.

### If you have any issues
